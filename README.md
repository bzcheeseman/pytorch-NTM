# pytorch-NTM
I'm going to try and implement this architecture: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf

I've taken a lot of inspiration from: https://github.com/snipsco/ntm-lasagne

This will be used for other work in the future too so hopefully it's extensible and able
to be used in other projects.

I've just coded something neat that I'll be working on from here forward using this code - my new [pytorch-EMM project](https://github.com/bzcheeseman/pytorch-EMM). 
It's basically a project for just the external memory part of the NTM, which allows us to unlock the updates (if we wanted to)
or do other cool stuff!
